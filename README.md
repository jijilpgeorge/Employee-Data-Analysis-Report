Description

This project involves the analysis of a dataset provided by ABC company, focusing on employee distribution, salary patterns, and demographic trends. The aim is to preprocess the dataset, perform statistical analysis, and present the findings through visualizations. The report provides insights into team and position distributions, salary expenditures, predominant age groups, and the correlation between age and salary.
